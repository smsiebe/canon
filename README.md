Event Stream Framework

Canon is a specialized distributed sequential event store.  

**Program Background**

   Canon is the backbone of the [terpene](https://terpene.geoint.org)
platform, providing a communication and data persistence framework to realize 
the data confidentiality, complete non-repudiation, and availability 
requirements of terpene.  

   Canon can be used as an embedded database, as a network service, or a 
combination of the two to support offline operations.

   Though canon may be used as the primary data store for traditional applications 
architectures, the power of canon comes from the way it facilitates an 
alternative approach to implementing data persistence and retrieval within 
an application.
